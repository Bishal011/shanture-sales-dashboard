# Shanture Sales Analytics Dashboard

This is a full-stack sales analytics dashboard built with the MERN stack (MySQL, Express, React, Node.js). The application visualizes sample sales data, allowing users to view key metrics through interactive charts and filter data by a specific date range.

## 🚀 Features

* **Backend API:** A RESTful API built with Express.js and Sequelize that connects to a MySQL database.
* **Data Visualization:** A responsive dashboard with three charts displaying:
    * Total Revenue by Date (Line Chart)
    * Top 5 Selling Products (Bar Chart)
    * Sales by Region (Pie Chart)
* **Interactive Filtering:** Users can filter the displayed data by selecting a custom date range.
* **Database Seeding:** A script to automatically create the database schema and populate it with realistic, large-scale sample data.
* **Professional UI:** A clean, modern, and visually appealing user interface with a dark theme.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React, ECharts for React, Axios, React Datepicker
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL2, CORS
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Other:** Faker.js for data seeding

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* MySQL Server (v8 or higher)
* MySQL Workbench or a similar database client

### Step 1: Database Setup

1.  Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your MySQL server.
2.  Create a new empty schema (database) named `shanture_sales_db`.

### Step 2: Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the backend dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your MySQL credentials.
    ```ini
    DB_NAME=shanture_sales_db
    DB_USER=your_username
    DB_PASS=your_password
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=3306
    ```
4.  Run the seed script to create tables and populate the database. **You only need to run this once.**
    ```bash
    node seed.js
    ```
5.  Start the backend server.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

1.  Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the frontend dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory with the backend API URL.
    ```ini
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/analytics
    ```
4.  Start the React development server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🖥️ API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints, which are consumed by the frontend to display the charts. All endpoints require `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters.

* `GET /api/analytics/revenue-by-date`: Retrieves total revenue grouped by date.
* `GET /api/analytics/top-selling-products`: Retrieves the top 5 selling products by quantity.
* `GET /api/analytics/region-sales`: Retrieves total revenue and orders grouped by region.
